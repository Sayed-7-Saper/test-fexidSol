# DevOps-project - Terraform Infrastructure Deployment
you have been tasked to design and provision the
required infrastructure and deploying the application using CICD pipeline, noting that
the design you will create should take into consideration that the application is a micro-
services app.

Requirements:
• You need to include a design diagram in your submission as well as a GitHub link
that include a readme file explaining the steps you followed to deploy both.
• The design you will create needs to be cost optimized.
• Infrastructure should be implemented via code (Terraform / Cloud-Formation).
• Infra-structure and application deployments creation should be done via CICD
pipeline.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this Terraform code, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:

- [Terraform ](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) configured with appropriate credentials

## Getting Started

1. Clone the DevOps-project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sayed-7-Saper/test-fexidSol.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the Terraform directory:

    ```bash
    cd fixedSol/Terraform
    ```
3. Initialize Terraform:


    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

    Modify the terraform.tfvars file to provide the required variables and configurations for your environment.

    Review and adjust the Terraform code in the .tf files according to your specific infrastructure requirements.

4. Plan the Terraform deployment:

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

5. Deploy the infrastructure:

    ```bash
    terraform apply --auto-approve
    ```



## Infrastructure Overview

The Terraform code in this repository is designed to deploy a comprehensive infrastructure for the DevOps-project. The infrastructure includes various components that work together to support the project's functionality and operations. Below is an overview of the key components that will be deployed:

### Network Setup

The network setup involves creating Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources such as subnets, route tables, and security groups. The VPC provides isolated networking environments for the rest of the infrastructure components. Security groups are configured to control inbound and outbound traffic, ensuring a secure network environment.

### EC2 Instances

EC2 instances are launched within the previously defined subnets. These instances serve as compute resources to host applications, services, and databases. The Terraform code allows specifying instance types, AMIs, and other configuration options.

### Amazon ECR Repositories

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repositories are created to store Docker container images. These repositories provide a secure and scalable way to manage container images that can be used for deploying applications in containers.

### Private Key Generation

A private key pair is generated to enable secure access to EC2 instances. The private key is generated locally and securely stored. It can be used to SSH into instances for troubleshooting or management purposes.

### Terraform Backend with Amazon S3

Terraform's state files are stored remotely in an Amazon S3 bucket. This helps maintain the state of your infrastructure across different environments and team members. Additionally, a DynamoDB table is used for locking to prevent concurrent modifications to the state.

### Amazon EKS Cluster

An Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster is provisioned using the Terraform EKS module. EKS provides managed Kubernetes clusters for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes.

This Terraform setup creates a robust and scalable infrastructure that supports the DevOps-project's requirements. Each component is carefully configured to ensure security, reliability, and ease of management.

## Cleaning Up

When you no longer need the resources created by Terraform, it's important to clean up and destroy those resources to avoid incurring unnecessary costs. Follow the steps below to properly clean up the infrastructure:

1. Open a terminal :

    ```bash
    terraform destroy --auto-aprove
    ```
    You'll be prompted to confirm the destruction of the resources. Type yes to proceed.

2. Terraform will start destroying the resources based on the configuration in your .tf files. The process may take some time depending on the complexity of your infrastructure.

3. Once the destruction is complete, Terraform will display a summary of the resources that were destroyed. Review the output to ensure that all resources were removed successfully.

    Note: The terraform destroy command will permanently delete all the resources managed by Terraform. This action cannot be undone, so exercise caution before confirming.

    It's important to clean up the resources to avoid unnecessary charges on your cloud account. If you plan to continue using the infrastructure later, consider using separate environments or configurations to isolate resources and test deployments without impacting your main environment.

    Remember that the Terraform state may still contain information about the destroyed resources. If you want to completely remove all traces of the infrastructure, you can manually delete the Terraform state files from the backend.
